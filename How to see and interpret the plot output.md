Below is a screen shot of a trace from an ADS1015 configured as single-ended by virtue of HighestBitResFromAddonADC being set to 11 (that's 11 bits of resolution).  The sketch was compiled for no analog pin connections and one ADS1X15 connection.  That ends up being two traces because one is unity scaled (blue) and the other is magnified (red).  The third line that appears at full-scale half the time and at the bottom the other half the time is simply the time and scale marker.  The color legend in the upper right corner of the image shows the three line colors in the order that the sketch sends to readings to the plotter monitor.  No other color control nor labeling is allowed by the IDE, nothing we can do about it without the IDE getting upgraded.

The setup uses a 1 Mohm resistor and a red bell pepper plant almost fresh from the store with the reference electrode poked into the very wet soil.  I tried for only a moment to convince the plant to show a response, but I'm not at all confident that one electrode in the soil is the best way of connecting the electrodes.  I'll try to determine the best way with more experimentation.  I DID notice that the whole arrangement has polarized conductance.  That means that it is very likely going to matter which electrode goes to which of your two chosen electrode locations as to whether you may even be able to see a response, but the polarization might instead originate at dissimilar materials junctions as it does in a semiconductor diode between the bipolar (negative doped and positive doped) layers.

You will notice that the blue unity gain line appears almost perfectly halfway in the range for that pin.  That just happened to work out with the 1 Mohm resistor.  Frankly, I was surprised that it worked out like that since that was the first resistor value I tried!

Why all the noise?  I haven't investigated that, yet, but I was VERY lax employing any noise filtering practices for this trace.  I have an LM334 on order to remove power supply noise, and I'm thinking I'll just wait until that part arrives to worry any more about it.  If its not power supply noise, it could be noise on reference ground or environmental electrical noise induced into my wires, maybe even from a cell phone or wifi device.  If it were more random, I would have suspected loose connection[s] somewhere.  If it shows a very regular pattern, it likely indicates aliasing with a radiated power line, cell phone, wifi device or radio signal.  Coax for the electrode leads may be in order, but allow for easy polarity swapping as close as possible to the plant end of the leads so that the shield can always remain connected to signal ground.  That can be done with a four-way light switch at the plant end of the coax.  Regarding noise mitigation, read my document offering more construction details.

BE SURE TO UNDERSTAND THIS: The vertical positioning of the _magnified_ line has no meaning...it is just at the height that the calculations decided it would get displayed within the max and min scale for that pin.  **_When the reading would cause the magnified line to print outside the bounds for that pin, the height of the magnified line will get adjusted so it will continue to appear in bounds._**  The [preprocessor macro] definition REPOSITION_RATIO_OF_MAGNIFIED_VIEW_WHEN_LIMITS_GET_EXCEEDED will provide you with some flexibility repositioning the magnified trace back into the range when it would otherwise extend beyond an upper or lower limit.  Yes, we all do wish that the time-past part of the line could get height-adjusted right along with the time-future part of the line, but alas, the IDE provides no way to do that.

Below is a screen shot of a ADS1115 with one differential-connected input configured as differential by virtue of HighestBitResFromAddonADC being set to 16 (that's 16 bits of resolution across a range of 4.something volts).  There is no plant being viewed, just two circuits of one LM334 in series with a 1 Mohm resistor, one circuit to the A0 input and one to the A1 input of a single differential PGA (Programmable Gain Amplifier) set for a gain of one.  Again, the blue line is the unamplified trace and is shown in correct relation to full-scale while the red amplified trace could be placed anywhere it happened to fit dynamically within the range for the corresponding input.  The amplification factor is 400.  A note for trainees, as I'll call folks learning with this training aid, that the vertical placement of the unmagnified differential trace is always displayed relative to the reference input of that differential amplifier.  If the plant's conductance changes enough to force the voltage of that bridge leg beyond the ADC full scale voltage relative to the reference input, a complete recalculation (just like happens to the magnified trace) must occur along with an adjustment to the reference input bridge leg.  At this stage of development, that adjustment is not yet automated but is planned through the use of programmable potentiometers.

Below is a screen shot of an HX711 trace below two inboard traces.  Note that in the defines section of the sketch, I've defined  MAGNIFICATION_FACTOR to be 100, REPOSITION_RATIO_OF_MAGNIFIED_VIEW_WHEN_LIMITS_GET_EXCEEDED to be (.99), HIGHEST_SENSI_PGA_GAIN_FACTOR to be 128, USING_LM334_WITH_MCP4162_POTS, INBOARDINPARALLELWITHHIGHESTSENSI and POTTESTSTEPUPDOWN to be true, as well as other relevant defines.  I'm not being more explicit b/c you need to be fully engaged mentally so I don't have to be so utterly perfect in my explanations at this early point in the project's presentation.  Note that POTTESTSTEPUPDOWN is only expected to be used in a troubleshooting or development environment.  Note that, due to the .99 screen repositioning of the magnified trace, when that trace would go out of the lower bounds of its tracespace, it gets repositioned way back up high ( 99% in its tracespace ) for the next plot point.  

I learned through experimentation that the HX711's sensitivity or gain is only available in an extremely small common-mode voltage window where the inboard analog inputs read 306 out of 1024.  Therefore, I have developed auto-balancing into the setup function that can balance to any specified common-mode voltage level that fits the ADC being used.

Note also that a 1 Mohm resistor is being used in place of the plant, fed by an LM334, and a second one is used in the opposing Wheatstone bridge leg as tha load for that second LM334.  The resistor values of the MCP4162 pots are 100K x2 and 10K x1, and their values are being manipulated in the lower third or less of their resistance ranges. 

Note in the magnified trace wherever the timing trace crosses minimum to maximum or vice versa, that all the signal traces bridge that appearance of a window of time as horizontal no-changes.  if you don't like those horizontal bridges, you would have to turn off the timeline notches by so modifying the code, since I have not made a define to do it.![Screen shot with POTTESTSTEPUPDOWN set](https://github.com/kenneth558/plant_resistance_primary_perception/blob/Free/embeddeds/POTTESTSTEPUPDOWN.png)
