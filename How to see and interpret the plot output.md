Below is a screen shot of a trace from an ADS1115 (that's 15 bits of resolution).  The sketch was compiled forzero analog pin connections and one ADS1X15 connection.  That ends up being two traces because one is unity scaled (blue) and the other is magnified (red).  The third line that appears at full-scale half the time and at the bottom the other half the time is simply the time and scale marker.  The color legend in the upper right corner of the image shows the three line colors.
