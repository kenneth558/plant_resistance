Jesus cursed the fig tree, it withered away, and He said we would do the same
(Matt 21:19-21 https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt+21%3A19-21&version=KJV):

# 19 And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let
#     no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away.
# 20 And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away!
# 21 Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this 
#     which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the
#     sea; it shall be done.
    
When we read this passage, we often overlook the phrase "...ye shall not only do this  which is done to the fig tree...".
But that oft-overlooked phrase contains just as profound a truth as the phrase following it about casting mountains!  Jesus
did not condemn us if we should curse a plant, but we also must not forget John 14:12:

# 12 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than 
    these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.

Ask yourself what a greater work might be than cursing a plant to kill it.  How about blessing a plant to cause its health
to be better than normal?  Mark 16:15:

# 15 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.

Focus your attention on the word "creature".  That includes plants!

I believe it is now time to demonstrate the truthfulness of the Bible in the context that can be done by measuring the
resistance of plant tissue as it responds in vivo to sentiments of good news to it from human beings that plants recognize
as royalty of creation.  It would be of great benifit for us to recognize that we are royalty, just as the plants 
recognize who we are.

Galatians 4:1-7:

# 1 Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;
# 2 But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.
# 3 Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:
# 4 But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,
# 5 To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.
# 6 And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.
# 7 Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.
