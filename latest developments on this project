19 May 2018 I received the LM334 and tested the noise level with and without it.  I am pleased to say that the noise level IS lower using that part.  However, in my efforts to investigate into more detail, I discovered that the ADS ADC I was using is exactly what I ordered - an ADS1015.  That means it is only a 12-bit ADC, and I want the 16-bit ADC for greater resolution.  Work on this project will therefore be stalled until my newly-ordered ADS1115 arrives in a couple weeks (I paid $2.35 extra for expedited delivery this time)
