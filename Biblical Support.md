Jesus cursed the fig tree, it withered away, and He said we would do the same [Matt 21:19-21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt+21%3A19-21&version=KJV):

## 19 And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away.
## 20 And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away!
## 21 Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.
#      
When we read this passage, we too often overlook the phrase "...ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree...".  But that oft-overlooked phrase contains just as profound a truth as the phrase following it about casting mountains!  Jesus did not condemn us if we should curse a plant, yet we must not forget [John 14:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A12&version=KJV):
## Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.
Ask yourself what a greater work might be than cursing a plant to kill it.  How about blessing a plant to cause its health to be better than normal?  [Mark 16:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+16%3A15&version=KJV):
## And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.
I draw your attention on the word "creature".  That includes plants!  And note that the definition of "gospel" is "good news"

In summary, Jesus accepted the fact that people would kill plants like fig trees with a curse but also said we will do greater than that.  It is with the hope that we will do far, *far* more of the latter than the former that I make the plans for this project freely available to everyone.  I am convinced that it is NOW time to demonstrate the truthfulness of the Bible in this context!  That is by monitoring the electrical resistance of plant tissue in vivo as it responds to sentiments of good news delivered to it from human beings that plants recognize as royalty in the creation.  To understate my point - it would be of great benefit for us to recognize that we are royalty, just as the plants recognize that humans are royalty in the creation.

[Galatians 4:1-7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+4%3A1-7&version=KJV):
## 1 Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;
## 2 But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.
## 3 Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:
## 4 But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,
## 5 To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.
## 6 And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.
## 7 Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.
