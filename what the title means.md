##  <p align="center">Telempathic Horticulture - Promoting a Reviving Civility (TM)
###  <p align="center">What does this project's title mean, anyway?

The goal of the Telempathic Horticulture Arduino training aid is to display a magnified view of the effect on a plant of someone's civil sentiments towards it so a person can see that effect much more readily.  I think of it as being like watching the minute hand move on a clock face - the longer the minute hand or the more magnification we view it through, the easier it is to see it moving in real time.  My selection of the term "telempathic" is to emphasize the fact that you'll need to exert empathetic type effort towards the plant to obtain successful results.  My selection of the term "horticulture" promotes the beneficial use instead of the easier and more popular destructive use of our telempathic effects on plants.  The destructive aspect of telempathy towards plants was demonstrated on the Mythbuster's television program episode "Deadly Straw".  Just for clarity, their title of that episode was not at all related to telempathy but to a different aspect of that same episode which investigated tornadic force impalement by a stalk of straw.

Did you ever watch a theatrical performance or movie and be so caught up in it that you were, like, disoriented for a while afterwards?  A good performance can do that to people.  Admittedly, it can be a weakness that we are susceptible to such phsychological manipulation, but on the other hand wouldn't you agree that it can be used for good as well?  Practicing horticulture telempathically requires the conveyence of civil sentiments towards plants.  That telempathic civility not only will revive the plant but will also revive kindness in the person practicing it.  Our society is wholesale showing itself to be in dire need of civility.  Embracing and practicing civility will revive life and strength in a society just as surely as incivility will lead to its destruction and death.

If you'll consider just the last two terms "reviving civility" standing alone, they would denote both the effect of civility if thought of as adjective-noun and, if thought of as verb-object, a goal of this project.
