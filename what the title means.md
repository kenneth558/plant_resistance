Jesus taught us to pray "Thy Kingdom Come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven."  It is difficult at best to know what heaven culture is without REVELATION by God to us.  God is in the business of revealing to us what He wants us to know.  I believe He wants us to know what Heaven culture would look like so we don't fight it when we see it.  God uses a few different revelatory techniques for this.  The one He calls "more sure" is written revelation that He inspires.  The Bible is widely recognized as the primary means of that more sure level of revelation.  Near death experiences (NDEs) are another revelatory technique, but at a less "sure" level, as are direct visits to heaven.  These two revelatory techniques are mentioned in the Bible (John 12:11, 2 Corinthians 12:2), as is a third revelatory technique told of in 1 John 4:1-3 that I'll call "spirits from God".  

According to Jesus words in the Bible, those who have faith and doubt not will influence plants by little more than speaking to them.  In 1966, a polygraph expert named Cleve Backster discovered that electrical conductance of his office Dracaena plant responded to Backster's sentiments towards and against the plant.  The Arduino-based project I'm developing displays that electrical behavior of a plant under your observation show you in real time how well you are doing getting your sentiments through to the plant.  Had This device been available to Jesus' followers, they wouldn't have had to wait overnight to notice that the fig tree was responding to Jesus.  Read about Jesus and that fig tree in Matt. 21 and Mark 11.  You should find it very interesting, if you think about it, that Jesus would use that event to tell of casting a mountain into the sea.  My assumption is that we will soon have a need to do such a thing.

In 1985, an atheist college professor, Howard Storm, on tour with his students in Paris had an NDE.  During his experience, he met Jesus and angels who showed him many things, among which is that people will grow their food at mealtime throgh the practice of what appeared to be Cleve Backster's and Jesus' knowledge.  Needless to say, Howard Storm stopped being an atheist during that NDE.  He has loved Jesus ever since.
