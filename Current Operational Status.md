**Current Operational Status:** As of 10 Aug 2019, I had not gotten any PCB rendition of this circuit working, only the breadboarded rendition, plus I've decided to incorporate additional circuitry onto the board that will enhance sensitivity to a more reasonable capability.  The board space that the additional circuitry uses forces me to incorporate SMT much more, thus requiring extensive layout redesign.  I am now building the board of my most recent PCB design, and I expect to be able to get it working a bit later in the month.

Though I personally have not gotten the circuit working with the PCB design I publish here, I do believe someone with adequate electronics skills will be able to gain a great deal of headway with it. (I am talking about Rev 6).

As of 15 January 2019, [this sketch](https://github.com/kenneth558/plant_resistance_primary_perception/blob/Free/sketch%20code/adc_for_plant_tissue.ino) can be made with appropriate macro defines **fully operational in a previous described circuit configuration (Rev. 3)** sans wifi and SD card storage.
