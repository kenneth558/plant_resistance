**Current Operational Status:** [This sketch](https://github.com/kenneth558/plant_resistance_primary_perception/blob/Free/sketch%20code/adc_for_plant_tissue.ino) is **fully operational** in a very specific circuit configuration.  

------------------------------------

The specific circuit configuration you'll need with this current sketch version can be described as follows.  The description is to some extent covert because this stage of development requires you to be or become conversant/knowledgeable about things electronic and Arduino, anyway.  Vendors I use to purchase these are shown in [this page](https://github.com/kenneth558/plant_resistance_primary_perception/blob/Free/More%20construction%20details.md) near the end of it.

**Two MCP4162-503** with some way to connect into the circuit.  The sketch code refers to these as LSB.

**Two or Four MCP4162-104** with some way to connect into the circuit.  (Confused how many? My development circuit is built with four, but two of those four never impact operation.  The sketch thinks there are four.  I believe having only two will work fine.)  The sketch code refers to these as MID and MSB.  Only the MID impacts operation.

**Two LM334** ICs with some way to connect into the circuit - each need their + pins connected to Arduino 5v power.  Each also needs one MCP4162-503 digipot resistor and half the amount of MCP4162-104 digipot resistors connected in series between their current programming pins and their - pins.  Connect each digipot CS pin to the appropriate Arduino Digital pin based on comments in the sketch code.

**One minimal-wattage resistor** of similar resistance as the plant tissue with some way to connect into the circuit.  A resistance value of 1 Mohm works for me, and yes, I AM amazed that such a common value seems to work out fine.  The place this gets connected into the circuit is the reference leg of the Wheatstone bridge as the leg load resistance.  Note that the other Wheatstone bridge leg, the one used to balance the reference leg, is called the signal leg, and its load resistance is the plant tissue under test, AKA Device Under Test (DUT).

**One AD8244** with the soldering where-with-all (including soldering skills) to match.  These tiny parts, hyperbolically speaking, are microscopic in size, since they were evidently never intended for use by the hobbyist market.  Solder to the MSOP-10 PCB ADAPTER BOARD listed next or maybe you know of an inexpensive socket you can use instead.  I wish I knew of such a socket, but I don't.

**One MSOP-10 PCB ADAPTER BOARD** with some way to connect into the circuit.

**One HX711** with some way to connect into the circuit.  In my early development work, I got the ADS1015 and ADS1115 working, but have not kept that functionality maintained.  Hopefully it still works.  I advise a unique connection into the ADS1x15 circuit ground as I describe on the page entitled "[More construction details.md](https://github.com/kenneth558/plant_resistance_primary_perception/blob/Free/More%20construction%20details.md)".

**Power supply decoupling (low ESR) capacitors as needed** with some way to connect into the circuit.  At least .1uF in capacitance.  The digipots may need .5uF-2.0uF or more just for them in totality as I am seeing some possibly related artifact in my development circuit that I should investigate later before quitting my day job.

**Arduino board with power/serial communications cable**.  I am doing my latest development work on a Leonardo, but my earlier work was done on the Uno.  I have written my code to accommodate the TTGO XI, but have never tried the sketch with it.

Suggested **two graphite motor brushes** or whatever electrode style you prefer, with some way to connect their wire end electrically into the coax cable and some way to insert their graphite end FULLY into the electrolyte pouches.  You may want to consider that Cleve Backster just used leaves of  medical laboratory grade stainless steel with salt-impregnated agar for the electrolyte contact.  Will just the bare end of wires work?  I'm sure they will, but I'm describing a way that I intend will minimize galvanic potential and maximize bio-compatibility of materials that contact the plant.  I've not gotten to the point on this project where I've started any R & D concerning this.

**two pliable electrolyte-filled fabric pouches** able to have motor brushes FULLY inserted past the graphite tips.  You may want to consider that Cleve Backster just used salt-impregnated agar and medium-knit (I think) medical-grade cotton patches shaped beyond the leaves of stainless that he used for the electrodes.  To maximize bio-compatibility, I am suggesting instead that the electrolyte be mud rather than salt.  I've not gotten to the point on this project where I've started any R & D concerning this.

Why do I emphasize FULLY inserted?  Because the circuit is tracking potentially extremely tiny changes of electrical current through a potentially _relatively_ low electrical resistance...relative, that is, to the size of the signal of interest, if you'll allow me to compare apples to oranges electronically.  The accumulative electrical contact resistance of the entire electrode circuit MUST be so extremely low compared to the resistance of the plant to make the inevitable fluctuations to it during operation infintessimal in their effect.  That means that the lowest contact resistance between the motor brush assembly and electrolyte is sought which is achieved by the most contact area against the surface of the graphite.  Making contact past the graphite onto the copper provides that final extent of contact, though it begins to risk greater galvanic potential being generated.  Since Cleve Backster obtained valid results without trying to minimize galvanic potential, I'm suggesting to err on the side of generating a little of it (by direct copper contact with the electrolyte) in favor of minimizing the contact resistance fluctuations, which will be greater when produced by changes in graphite surface contact vs. copper contact.

**length of insulated coaxial cable** with some way to connect into the circuit.  This connects the plant tissue via electrodes into the circuit's Wheatstone bridge signal leg as the load/DUT (Device Under Test).  The shield of the coax connects to circuit ground, the center conductor connects to the - lead of the LM334 on the signal side of the Wheatstone bridge.

**optional 4-way light switch** if you want to experiment with polarity.  With some way to mount at the plant end of the coax as close to the electrodes as practical, connect, and insulate.  If such a 4-way switch is used, there is no reason to make the remainder of the wiring to the electrodes to be coaxial.  Just use twisted pair for it.  Attach to the 4-way thusly: the two coax ends to the screw terminals at one END of the switch (END, NOT SIDE!) and the twisted pair ends to the screw terminals at the other END (END, NOT SIDE) of the 4-way.  If this will help clarify what I'm calling and end vs. what I'm calling a side, I'll go further to say that the captive screws used to mount the switch into an electrical box will be located one at each END of the switch, NOT each side of the switch.

**insulated electrodes support (clamp/holder/stand/arm/goose neck/...)** with some means of fastening it between electrodes and floor/table/soil while applying a clamping force on the electrodes against opposing surfaces of the leaf or other plant part[s].  Please ensure that no part of this assembly that may possibly contact the plant is electrically conductive because interfering electrical path fluctuations will result from any such electrical contact.

**computer** placed near enough to provide Arduino connection and show the Arduino IDE Serial Plotter rendered on the monitor for the user to observe.

---------------------
The changes I am still developing are merely changes to #1) allow more flexibility in the circuit and #2) speed up resistance range changes during use.  Circuitry flexibility hopes are to allow both fewer and more digital potentiometers per bridge leg, to allow bridge legs to be made without LM334s, to allow non-LM334 legs to be unbridged, to accommodate outboard ADCs of types beyond the HX711, and to allow for use of more than just one outboard ADC.
