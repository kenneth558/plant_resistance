**Current Operational Status:** 

I'm changing out the Rail-to-Rail input (RRI) unity gain buffer for a non-RRI device to alleviate the killer crossover distortion.  Give me another month to finish that aspect.  Once I get the project working with the new device, I'll focus on sketch upgrading.  I haven't even thought much about a project enclosure for it, either.  I do think it needs an enclosure to slow down the temperature changes when the ambient air moves.  A grounded metal one would also attenuate the effect of moving electrical charges nearby.  Both effects are very, very noticeable.  Until they are dealt with, I withhold judgment as to the functionality with a realistic DUT.  

A "shield pouch" or "foil bag" enclosing the flex board will greatly lower the noise level with high-impedance DUTs.  I have not found a source for such a commercially available shield.  A custom shield pouch for the flex board will be added in Version 1.1; in the meantime you'll have to fashion your own using metal foil and insulating tape.  

Version 1.x built units will be labeled "This Version 1.x Training Aid Is Without Temperature Compensation, Useful For Observing Conductance Behavior, But Not For True And Honest Measuring.  Development Level Units Prior To Version 2.0 Are Not Intended For Repeatable Or Reproducible Precision Laboratory-Class Measurements".

Because true measuring with electrodes is very dependent on electrode contact surface area and other factors that are not easily and conveniently controlled outside a laboratory setting, units built and manufactured at this Version 1.x level should meet the expectations of the vast majority of users.

I hope to begin development on a temperature-compensated Version 2.0 in the future, but I'll need to catch up financially first by selling kits and fully-built units at the current version level.
