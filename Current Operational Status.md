**Current Operational Status:** As of 25 Aug 2019, I have the "newest" circuitry working at 5VDC, but it is not fully stable at 3.3VDC when a transient overload condition occurs.   I will watch for this behavior in the upcoming revision 8 on order from the PCB maker now.  BTW, the working circuitry  demonstrated that I needed to make a Rev. 8 level, so please wait until mid- to late-October for that to be tested.
