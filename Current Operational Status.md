**Current Operational Status:** As of 25 Aug 2019, I have Rev. 7 circuitry working at 5VDC, but it is not fully stable at 3.3VDC when a transient overload condition occurs.  Operating the Rev. 7 PCB has shown me that I needed to make a change to the circuitry.  I've made the design change and await delivery of the new PCB, named Rev. 8.  It will need a flex circuit board plugged into it.  The flex board is designed as well, and I await its delivery.  Please wait until mid- to late-October 2019 for that to arrive, get built, and be tested.

If you wonder what it was about Rev. 7 didn't work well, it was the fact that I had made the current-to-voltage-signal stage far more sensitive than the LSB dPot could zero in on for screen placement.  IOW, as small as the LSB dPot step was, it simply was not a small enough step to change the trace placement finely enough not to overshoot the entire screen during auto-adjust.  The only solution I could think of to this problem is parallel several of those dPots together...26 of them, in fact.  That is where the flex board comes in - it holds all those other dPots.  By using 26, their entire device resistance value becomes as close as possible to equaling one single resistance step of the MSB dPot.  That is the ideal step ratio.
