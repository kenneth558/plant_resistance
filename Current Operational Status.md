**Current Operational Status:** As of 26 Apr 2019, I had not gotten any PCB rendition of this circuit working, only breadboarded, and I've decided to incorporate additional circuitry onto the board anyway that will enhance sensitivity to a more reasonable capability.  The board space that the additional circuitry uses forces me to use SMD much more, thus requiring extensive layout redesign.  My final PCB design was sent to the fabricating house 09 June 2019.  No word from them as to when they'll send the panel to be made, but I expect not to be able to get a working build made until July or August 2019.

Though I personally have not gotten the circuit working with the PCB design I publish here, I do believe someone with adequate electronics skills will be able to gain a great deal of headway with it. (I am talking about Rev 3).  I submitted and order for v.5 PCB.  I'm skipping v.4 due to one last design enhancement being added just before ordering that PCB.  After submitting v.5 PCB design to the fabricator, I looked again into redesigning the front end and decided upon quite a different and better front end.  Therefore I will be working on that new design as the goal for the month (20 May 2019).

As of 15 January 2019, [this sketch](https://github.com/kenneth558/plant_resistance_primary_perception/blob/Free/sketch%20code/adc_for_plant_tissue.ino) can be made with appropriate macro defines **fully operational in the described circuit configuration** sans wifi and SD card storage.
