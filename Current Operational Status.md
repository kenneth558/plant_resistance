**Current Operational Status:** As of 09 Oct 2019, I have Rev. 8 circuitry working at 5VDC, but it is not fully stable at 3.3VDC when a transient overload condition occurs.  A "shield pouch" or "foil bag" enclosing the flex board will greatly lower the noise level with high-impedance DUTs.  I have not found a source for such a commercially available shield.

I will soon adjust the "Revision" numbering to restart with "Version 1.0".  A custom shield pouch for the flex board will be added in Version 1.1; in the meantime you'll have to fashion your own.  

Version 1.x units will be labeled "This Version 1.x Training Aid Is Without Temperature Compensation, Useful For Observing Conductance Behavior, But Not For True And Honest Measuring.  Development Level Units Prior To Version 2.0 Are Not Intended For Repeatable Or Reproducible Precision Laboratory-Class Measurements".

I hope to begin development on a temperature-compensated Version 2.0 in the future, but I'll need to catch up financially first by selling kits and fully-built units at the current version level.  Because true measuring with electrodes is very dependent on electrode contact surface area and other factors that are not easily and conveniently controlled outside a laboratory setting, units built and manufactured at this Version 1.x level should meet the expectations of the vast majority of users.
