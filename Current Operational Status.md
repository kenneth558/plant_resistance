**Current Operational Status:** Three new circuit boards arrived and are being built up for testing the latest circuit design. The first board lost a couple pads while getting solder tinned, but I always repair these types of failures by adding air-wires.  Expected finish in April

I'm changing out the Rail-to-Rail input (RRI) unity gain buffer for a non-RRI device to alleviate the killer crossover distortion.  Today (18 Jan 2020) I completed the rough PCB design as far as needed to ensure it will work, and I've begun a second examination for optimizing it.  Give me another month to finish.  Once I get the project working with the new device, I'll focus on sketch upgrading.  I haven't even thought much about a project enclosure for it, either.  I do think it needs an enclosure to slow down the temperature changes when the ambient air moves.  A grounded metal one would also attenuate the effect of moving electrical charges nearby.  Both effects are very, very noticeable.  Until they are dealt with, I withhold judgment as to the functionality with a realistic DUT.  

Version 1.x built units will be labeled "This Version 1.x Training Aid Is Without Temperature Compensation, Useful For Observing Conductance Behavior, But Not For True And Honest Measuring.  Development Level Units Prior To Version 2.0 Are Not Intended For Repeatable Or Reproducible Precision Laboratory-Class Measurements".

Units built and manufactured at this Version 1.x level should meet the expectations of the vast majority of users to *observe* the plant's response, but true *measuring* (as opposed to *observing*) with electrodes is very dependent on electrode contact surface area and other factors that are not easily and conveniently controlled outside a laboratory setting.

I hope to begin development on a temperature-compensated Version 2.0 in the future, but I'll need to catch up financially first by selling kits and fully-built units at the current version level.
