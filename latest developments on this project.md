19 May 2018 I received the LM334 and tested the noise level with and without it.  I am pleased to say that the noise level IS lower using that part.  However, in my efforts to investigate into more detail, I discovered that the ADS ADC I was using is exactly what I ordered - an ADS1015.  That means it is only a 12-bit ADC, and I want the 16-bit ADC for greater resolution.  Work on this project will therefore be stalled until my newly-ordered ADS1115 arrives in a couple weeks (I paid $2.35 extra for expedited delivery this time)

When I was testing with the LM334, which alternately is a temperature sensor, the temperature drift was too overwhelming to work without temperature compensation.  Temperature compensation is provided by a silicon diode and two resistors rather than one setting the current.  Those two resistors must be of an exact ratio to one another to cause the proper portion of the diode's temperature coefficient to exactly offset the LM334's opposite temperature coefficient.  Since I'm not going to force myself to buy the specified diode that provides exactly -10 times the LM334's temperature coefficient, and with programmable potentiometers (AD5242 and MCP41100) I don't need to, I'm just going to use a common diode such as 1N4148/1N914/1N4000 and write code that will proportion the resistances correctly and store that result in EEPROM.  Writing that code will add another week or more because I'll need to have the right conditions drop into my lap to get the time and conditions to do it.

When I've finished these tasks, I hope to offer a good estimate of how much better the LM334 is than just using a resistor to supply the current to the plant.
