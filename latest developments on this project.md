<dl><dt>29 May 2018</dt></dl>Decided I will need to support the ADS1231 as well.  The mention of diodes WRT tempco is obsolete with an additional LM334 (as mentioned in prior post) for tempco.  The HX711 will be difficult due to max scale occuring at 0.08 volts or less, and I feel that will be wishful thinking at best to insist on that close of a match between A0 and A1 legs in the lay person world besides dealing with the noise from all sources and junction contacts at that amplification.

<dl><dt>28 May 2018</dt></dl>I realized the advantage of reading differential when using the LM334s.  When I get differential reads working it will allow use of 24-bit load cell-type ADCs.  I have two 24-bit HX711 on hand, so the project will eventually additionally use HX711.  I expect first or second  week of June will see this project working with differential while still keeping the capability for single-ended.  I have secured domain names for "reviving civility" and "telempathic horticulture" which point here where they will remain pointed until I get a better page built.

<dl><dt>19 May 2018</dt></dl>I received the LM334 and tested the noise level with and without it.  I am pleased to say that the noise level IS lower when that part is used in the circuit as the source of the current going through the plant signal electrode.  However, in my efforts to investigate into more detail, I discovered that the ADS ADC I was using is exactly what I ordered - an ADS1015.  That means it is only a 12-bit ADC, and I want the 16-bit ADC for greater resolution.  Work on this project will therefore be stalled until my newly-ordered ADS1115 arrives in a couple weeks (I paid $2.35 extra for expedited delivery this time).  24 May - ADS1115 arrived, but unable to work on it for a few days due to being out of town for an extended family gathering.

When I was testing with the LM334, which alternately is a temperature sensor, the temperature drift was too overwhelming to work without temperature compensation.  Temperature compensation is provided by a silicon diode and two resistors (instead of one) setting the current.  Those two resistors must be of an exact ratio to one another to cause the proper portion of the diode's temperature coefficient to exactly offset the LM334's opposite temperature coefficient.  Since I'm not going to force myself to buy the specified diode that provides exactly -10 times the LM334's temperature coefficient, and with programmable potentiometers available (AD5242 and MCP41100) I don't need to, I'm just going to use a common diode such as 1N4148/1N914/1N4000 and write Arduino code that will proportion the resistances correctly for whatever diode is in the circuit and store that as a calibration in EEPROM.  Writing that code will add another week or more because I'll need to have the right conditions drop into my lap to get the time and conditions to work on it.  (Note to myself: the 1N457 has/had a tempco of -2.5mV/C while a 1N4148 might be anywhere between -2mV/C and -2.5mV/C, a 1:7.8 vs. 1:10 resistor ratio.)  UPDATE - I intend to forego the diode idea in favor of software compensation ujtilizing a second LM334 circuit sending a temperature driven analog signal to a second analog input.

I am unable to find programmable pots of sufficient resistance to directly utilize the zero tempco circuit as presented in application notes, so I will have to try variations on that theme.  Add more days/weeks to the tempco effort with an as yet unpredictable outcome.

When I've finished these tasks, I hope to offer a good estimate of how much better the LM334 is than just using a resistor to supply the current to the plant.  I expect to find that the use of an LM334, two programmable potentiometers, and a diode or so will actually be indispensible to use in place of a simple series resistor to the signal electrode.
