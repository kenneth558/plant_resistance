<dl><dt>17 July 2018</dt></dl>AD8244 arrived at 09:07.  Nice!  However, it's MSOP pin spacing is well less than SSOP.  I'll have to spread pins and hope for the best...
<dl><dt>16 July 2018</dt></dl>Since I conclude that buffers like AD8244 will be needed in any case, the Wemo XI Analog Inputs and ADS1x15 become just as viable as any other ADCs.  I will change comments in source code to that effect.

Received notice that my AD8244 has been shipped with overnight expidite, no extra charge.  ETA tomorrow, by 4:30pm.  Thank you, Lord!
<dl><dt>15 July 2018</dt></dl>Just discovered the HX711 input Z is way too low.  The datasheet hadn't specified it in any way, nor would I have deduced the implications anyway.  Regrouping...will need to use High-Z buffers (AD8244 or equivalent) or a different 24-bit ADC as the base device.  Ordered a AD8244....
<dl><dt>08 July 2018</dt></dl>My efforts continue to be sidetracked by the urgencies of property maintenance and repair.  My mower has broken irreparably, and with zero income, I haven't the money to do anything about it other than mow my lawn with a hand-held string trimmer.  I had to fire the crew that was repairing my garage due to their admitted inability to pass a drug test after I had been dismayed with their poor workmanship.  City hall has verbally indicated that the city is eyeing my property as being on the verge of getting written notices, only three which are allowed before city action to de-blight.  A realty company is having a hard time seeing a win-win path for me to sell due to the cost of fixing the house and garage.  

In light of all this, It would be irresponsible of me to work on this project at the expense of my house.  Progress on this telempathic gardening training aid, therefore, can be expected to be minimal for months to come.

<dl><dt>28 June 2018</dt></dl>My efforts have been sidetracked for some days by the urgencies of property maintenance and repair.

<dl><dt>20 June 2018</dt></dl>I had assumed the excitation voltage from the HX711 across the bridge circuit would be higher than it is in reality.  I though it would be high enough to include headroom for LM334s to operate in the upper halves of the bridge.  Not so.  The positive excitation voltage is less than 2.5 vdc using the high impedance scenario with the plant.  Not only that, but the negative bridge power is about a diode drop above ground.  I will have to supply the bridge from +5 and GND and see what that does to the noise floor.  Datasheet for HX711 says to supply less than within .1 vdc of Vdd, so I am risking a $1 part here...

<dl><dt>19 June 2018</dt></dl>I received the correct digi-pots and should be able to work on this project after I get some yard and house work done.  I added a .png screen shot file of a comparison between one inboard Analog Input vs. HX711.  I am very impressed at the lower noise level of the HX711.  Very impressed, indeed.  Note that LM334s are being used as the top component of both bridge legs.  That will be a standard inclusion in the circuit hereafter.

I am still unsure of the 24-bit differential non-magnified display amplitude.  It seems far too insensitive because it should max out with a 20mV tweak up or down, and I don't see it maxing out at all.  I'll investigate.  The good news is that this is nothing more than my suspicions of display amplitude of the lesser important trace, so I'm not declaring it a bug and especially not a real problem.

<dl><dt>17 June 2018</dt></dl>[OBSOLETE:Since the Wemos XI/TTGO XI and maybe other boards have worthless Analog Input pins, yet] two full-scale input pins connected to the two bridge compare points can be very useful when a 24-bit high sensitivity load cell ADC is used, I am contemplating how to change the sketch to accommodate, not just one, but two add-on ADCs.  This will also enable the sketch to be used with micro-controller board without any Analog Input pins, and ARM micro-computers (which have no Analog Input pins).  The alternative of using an analog buffer for the Wemos/TTGO would not be scalable to boards that have no Analog Inputs at all. I envision one of the add-on ADCs to be a full-scale ADC used for digital potentiometer setting to balance bridge legs and the other ADC will be the high-sensitivity ADC for magnified display.  The full-scale ADC levels will only be displayed when DEBUG_BRIDGE_BALANCING mode is defined.  The inputs of both ADCs will be in parallel, so both must be high impedance.  Note that the ADS devices are indeed full-scale and inexpensive, but they are not truly high-Z.  

In my datasheet research, I am finding that inexpensive ADCs like the ADS1x15 in general undesireably make the source (the plant in this case) charge a S/H capacitor.[As of 16 July 2018 this point is moot]  I'll investigate the ramifications of that after I get the digital potentiometers working to track and autobalance. 

I continue to be encouraged as I learn that most people I talk with pseudo-randomly accept the premise on which this project is based.  I really didn't use to think the acceptance level for telempathic horticulture was that high.  I'd say the time is finally right for this!

<dl><dt>15 June 2018</dt></dl>Received four MCP4162-103E/P instead of four MCP4162-104E/P...I've made the same mistake again!!!  Ordering again.

Using the MCP4162-103E/P that I had, I learned how to address two of them in case I need a second one in circuit for finer adjustment.

<dl><dt>08 June 2018</dt></dl>Had to re-order the programmable potentiometers due to the resistance value of 100 kOhm not being available from Chinese site, forcing me to order a 10 kOhm value that will require a series resistor and limit the adjustment range.  I must have gotten interrupted during that shopping effort and forgot to continue.  Will do what I can with the one I got and ordered from a stateside supply house for $5 shipping instead of free or pennies.  Upside is that I may receive the order in a week or two.

<dl><dt>05 June 2018</dt></dl>HX711 now supported...you'll have to balance the bridge yourself, though since my programmable potentiometer hasn't arrived.  Use a SAMPLE_TIMES of one.  I only tested with PGA A at default gain of 128.  This is a sensitivity breakthrough, since this little ADC converts a swing of a mere few millvolts into 24 bits compared with the ADS1115 converting rail-to-rail swing to 15 bits.  The ADS1115 sensitivity doesn't hold a candle to any ADC with a full-scale conversion range in the millivolts.  The library to use with HX711 is https://github.com/bogde/HX711  

I haven't completed constructing a satisfactory electrode subsystem yet...

<dl><dt>04 June 2018</dt></dl>Home maintenance issues are taking much of my time away from this project.  I am trying to develop a method of holding the electrode assembly against the leaf and keeping a good seal.  In a shopping trip to Menards-type and Walmart-type stores, I put together a few items to try various methods.

My programmable potentiometers haven't come in as of yesterday.  They are important for getting the HX711 going.  Otherwise, the only differential input devices I can support are those that have a full-scale range of near-rail-to-rail.

<dl><dt>29 May 2018</dt></dl>Considering supporting AD7780.  Looks like a good value 24-bit ADC for full-scale differential input...  ADS1242 as well.

<dl><dt>29 May 2018</dt></dl>Decided I will need to support the ADS1231 as well. The HX711 will be difficult due to max scale occuring at 0.08 volts or less, and I feel that will be wishful thinking at best to insist on that close of a match between A0 and A1 legs in the lay person world besides dealing with the noise from all sources and junction contacts at that amplification.  Considering LTC2400, AD779x and MAX112x0.

<dl><dt>28 May 2018</dt></dl>I realized the advantage of reading differential when using the LM334s.  When I get differential reads working it will allow use of 24-bit load cell-type ADCs.  I have two 24-bit HX711 on hand, so the project will eventually additionally use HX711.  I expect first or second  week of June will see this project working with differential while still keeping the capability for single-ended.  I have secured domain names for "reviving civility" and "telempathic horticulture" which point here where they will remain pointed until I get a better page built.

<dl><dt>19 May 2018</dt></dl>I received the LM334 and tested the noise level with and without it.  I am pleased to say that the noise level IS lower when that part is used in the circuit as the source of the current going through the plant signal electrode.  However, in my efforts to investigate into more detail, I discovered that the ADS ADC I was using is exactly what I ordered - an ADS1015.  That means it is only a 12-bit ADC, and I want the 16-bit ADC for greater resolution.  Work on this project will therefore be stalled until my newly-ordered ADS1115 arrives in a couple weeks (I paid $2.35 extra for expedited delivery this time).  24 May - ADS1115 arrived, but unable to work on it for a few days due to being out of town for an extended family gathering.

When I was testing with the LM334, which alternately is a temperature sensor, the temperature drift was too overwhelming to work without temperature compensation.  Temperature compensation is provided by a silicon diode and two resistors (instead of one) setting the current.  Those two resistors must be of an exact ratio to one another to cause the proper portion of the diode's temperature coefficient to exactly offset the LM334's opposite temperature coefficient.  Since I'm not going to force myself to buy the specified diode that provides exactly -10 times the LM334's temperature coefficient, and with programmable potentiometers available (AD5242 and MCP41100) I don't need to, I'm just going to use a common diode such as 1N4148/1N914/1N4000 and write Arduino code that will proportion the resistances correctly for whatever diode is in the circuit and store that as a calibration in EEPROM.  Writing that code will add another week or more because I'll need to have the right conditions drop into my lap to get the time and conditions to work on it.  (Note to myself: the 1N457 has/had a tempco of -2.5mV/C while a 1N4148 might be anywhere between -2mV/C and -2.5mV/C, a 1:7.8 vs. 1:10 resistor ratio.)  UPDATE - I intend to forego the diode idea in favor of software compensation ujtilizing a second LM334 circuit sending a temperature driven analog signal to a second analog input.

I am unable to find programmable pots of sufficient resistance to directly utilize the zero tempco circuit as presented in application notes, so I will have to try variations on that theme.  Add more days/weeks to the tempco effort with an as yet unpredictable outcome.

When I've finished these tasks, I hope to offer a good estimate of how much better the LM334 is than just using a resistor to supply the current to the plant.  I expect to find that the use of an LM334, two programmable potentiometers, and a diode or so will actually be indispensible to use in place of a simple series resistor to the signal electrode.
