1.  A decoupling capacitor is required at the ADS1X15 device VDD to GND.  From the datasheet:
>Good power-supply decoupling is important to achieve optimum performance. VDD must be decoupled with at least a 0.1-μF capacitor, as shown in Figure 47. The 0.1-μF bypass capacitor supplies the momentary bursts of extra current required from the supply when the device is converting. Place the bypass capacitor as close to the power-supply pin of the device as possible using low-impedance connections. Use multilayer ceramic chip capacitors (MLCCs) that offer low equivalent series resistance (ESR) and inductance (ESL) characteristics for power-supply decoupling purposes. For very sensitive systems, or for systems in harsh noise environments, avoid the use of vias for connecting the capacitors to the device pins for better noise immunity. The use of multiple vias in parallel lowers the overall inductance, and is beneficial for connections to ground planes.

2.  An RC filter to each used ADS1X15 analog input is advised by the manufacturer.  From the datasheet:
>...any noise pick-up along the sensor wiring or the application circuitry can potentially alias into the pass-band. Power line-cycle frequency and harmonics are one common noise source. External noise can also be generated from electromagnetic interference (EMI) or radio frequency interference (RFI) sources, such as nearby motors and cellular phones. Another noise source typically exists on the printed-circuit-board (PCB) itself in the form of clocks and other digital signals. Analog input filtering helps remove unwanted signals from affecting the measurement result...

3.  Unused analog input pins of the ADS1X15 should not be connected to GND or more power cupply current will be drawn than is necessary.  From the datasheet:
>Either float unused analog inputs, or tie the unused analog inputs to midsupply or VDD. Connecting unused analog inputs to GND is possible, but may yield higher leakage currents than the previous options.


Many other application tips are in the datasheet.  I don't mean to discourage you with technical reading, but those tips _are_ useful, and some diagrams are in there that could help hold your attention.  I won't include any links here b/c they so often go dead.  I'll offer one tip I didn't find stated very clear in the datasheet concerning ADS1X15 ground path.  The reference electrode wire should connect to the ADS1X15 approaching it from the opposite direction that it connects to the Arduino GND.  In other words, looking at the ADS1X15, it is a two sided device, front and back, where two two sides are divided from each other by a single row of pins.  If the Arduino GND connects via the back side, then the reference electrode wire should connect via the front side, or vice versa.  This means that the common practice of soldering header pins that exit only from the back side of the ADS1X15 should be critically reconsidered for its GND pin.  A longer than normal pin or wire should be used so it can provide connection both from the front side of the ADS1X15 and from the back, as in the picture below.![How the ground pin needs to extend from both sides of the ADS board](https://github.com/kenneth558/plant_resistance_primary_perception/blob/Free/adc%20primary%20perception%20ADS%20board%20ground%20pin%20cropped.jpg)  The power decoupling capacitor must *not* be connected on the ADS1X15 signal side of that pin/wire, yet as close as possible on the other (power) side.

Another note electronics-wise is that the inputs of the ADS device draw current from the device of interest connected.  The amount of that current depends on the the input voltage difference from 0.7 volts.  The electronics-saavy reader recognizes that voltage as a silicon diode junction voltage that will exist on the input pin when nothing is connected to it.  However, the current drawn is NOT that of a resistive load but rather, when used with the high impedance application of this project, a capacitive load.  The point being that the RC filter capacitance added to the input pins as mentioned in point 2 above actually increases the DC readings a small amount from what they would read without any added  capacitors on the input pins.  I only state this because I was initially puzzled by the input difference myself before I understood why a capacitor was changing the input voltage, and I don't want you to waste your time worrying about it if you notice it.
