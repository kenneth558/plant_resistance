DIY stencil from aluminum can
Felix Rusu's tutorials how to transform an aluminum Coke or Dr. Pepper can into a stencil using muriatic acid and 3% hydrogen peroxide to etch it:

If I could offer one improvisation I would try to copy the pattern to both sides of the aluminum and etch simultaneously from both sides.  But think it through before just doing this.

As an alternative to pick and place directly to PCB:  When I get around to making stencils this way, I'll probably also try to etch a component holder to load with a boardload of components upside down properly positioned.  The PCB with preloaded solder cream would be placed solder side down on top of the components.  When I get that component holder pattern perfected, I'll publish it.
