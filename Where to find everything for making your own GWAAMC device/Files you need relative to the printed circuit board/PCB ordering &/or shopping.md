### PCB Gerber files
##### Here is a link to the gerber files of my PCB design: https://github.com/kenneth558/plant_resistance_primary_perception/blob/Free/embeddeds/v.5%20training%20aid%20board%20gerbers.zip.  
I suggest NOT getting the tinned option simply because the crowned traces you'll have from it will make it seriously more difficult for you to place the MSOP10 packages.  While I really like ENIG as it provides a nice flat surface for easier placement of fine pitch components, on tiny pads you'll need to "wash" the pad by double-tinning the gold off or gold migration will make the solder brittle.  Tinning, double or otherwise, negates the whole reason in getting a flat surface, so the PCB design includes place-assist holes to help hold fine-pitch components in place during soldering.  Whether they'll serve the purpose remains to be seen, but if they do, you should be able to order HASL boards instead of ENIG.

### PCB Comparison sites
##### Printed circuit boards can be ordered from any one of a multitude of fabricators.  Compare between fabricators by visiting one or more of the fabricator comparison sites like https://www.pcbdirectory.com/get-quotations or https://pcbshopper.com or read the fabricator site collection list at https://www.eevblog.com/wiki/index.php?title=PCB_Manufacturers or search "online pcb quote".

The PCB project is also published by OSH Park PCB fabrication here: https://oshpark.com/projects/UHm82RXw.  
They would appreciate your business so long as you're buying only gold plated.  
 
 I would encourage you to order RoHS (environmental friendly) wherever you're given that option, paying a very slight extra to do so.  Especially if you appreciate me making these plans freely available and so plan to send me your excess.
