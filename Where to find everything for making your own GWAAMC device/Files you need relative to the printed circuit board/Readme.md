To buy your own PCB you'll send [this file](https://github.com/kenneth558/plant_resistance_primary_perception/blob/Free/Where%20to%20find%20everything%20for%20making%20your%20own%20GWAAMC%20device/Files%20you%20need%20relative%20to%20the%20printed%20circuit%20board/v1.0/uno%20shield%20v1.0%20PCB%20gerbers.zip) and [this file](https://github.com/kenneth558/plant_resistance_primary_perception/blob/Free/Where%20to%20find%20everything%20for%20making%20your%20own%20GWAAMC%20device/Files%20you%20need%20relative%20to%20the%20printed%20circuit%20board/v1.0/Quantum%20MCP4262-502%2026x%20expansion%20for%20GWAAM-Sea%20Aid%20gerbers.zip) to OSH Park, BasicPCB, PCBWay, or to wherever you choose, then pay and wait.  [This](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/wVbhEI2C) is the OSH Park project link for even easier ordering of the main board...and [aux board](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/kbQQkkZ4) at OSH Park. A minimum quantity purchase of 3-5 boards is normal.

May be temporarily air-wired into operation while still in one piece.  This style may help you in PCB fabrication quoting and ordering, but it will be risky separating them.

I actually can't recommend the ENIG boards because industry wisdom is now that the gold on ENIG boards is better washed off ("cleansed") by double tinning - I've found that I have to wash it off, anyway, to get acceptable results.  That negates the entire advantage of ENIG's flat pads for fine pitch components because it takes several hours to double tin and flatten out the pads.  Then on top of that, the last HASL boards I ordered had taken sufficient precautions to give me flat pads on the side of the board it mattered most for me...without me even suggesting it!  That left only one single fine-pich component for me to worry about, and I took care of that easily with Kapton tape/hot air/hot iron pad flattening.  Besides, ENIG boards are limited to a six month shelf life.  So I'm going to recommend just getting 2oz,TG170, lead-free HASL boards, requesting the fab house try to put flattest pads on the surface with the most fine-pitch packages, and flatten any other fine pitch pads yourself.  On the ENIG boards, a little solder flux helps conduct the heat and makes things less frustrating.  If there is any chance you'll use bismuth solder and you're going the HASL route, specify "lead-free" HASL.

If you are determined to purchase ENIG boards, you can't go wrong with OSH Park because their [rigid] boards handle the heat so well without the copper delaminating nor heat damage occuring otherwise.  I've read they use TG170.  Chinese boards default to TG140 and will darken and char at much lower heat levels than OSH Park boards, and their copper delaminates from the board at lower heat levels than OSH Park's 2 oz. boards.  OSH Park's flex boards, however, won't handle full-scale air heating without risking bubbles, but if you're careful to pop those bubbles while they're small, you should be fine.

When I got sloppy with the ENIG boards by putting on way more solder than I needed to, I did pull pads up, so you might as well be neat and frugal while tinning, including only tinning one side - the side you need to tin - on the plated through holes.
