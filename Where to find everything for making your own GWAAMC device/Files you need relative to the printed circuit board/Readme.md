To buy your own PCB you'll send [this file](https://github.com/kenneth558/plant_resistance_primary_perception/blob/Free/Where%20to%20find%20everything%20for%20making%20your%20own%20GWAAMC%20device/Files%20you%20need%20relative%20to%20the%20printed%20circuit%20board/uno%20shield%20v.6%20PCB%20gerbers.zip) to OSH Park or wherever you choose, then pay and wait.  A minimum quantity purchase of 3-5 boards is normal.  I actually can't recommend the OSH Park or anyone else's ENIG boards because industry wisdom is now that the gold on ENIG boards should be "washed" off by double tinning.  That negates the entire advantage of ENIG's flat pads with fine pitch components because it takes several hours to double tin and flatten out the pads.  Besides ENIG boards are limited to a six month shelf life.  I recommend just getting HASL boards and straight out flatten those pads if you don't get the place-assist holes on fully tinned to work for you. On the ENIG boards, a little solder flux helps conduct the heat and makes things less frustrating. When I got sloppy with the ENIG boards by putting on way more solder than I needed to, I pulled pads up, so you might as well be neat and frugal while tinning, including only tinning the only side you need to on the plated through holes.

If you are determined to purchase ENIG boards, you can't go wrong with OSH Park because their boards handle the heat so well without the copper delaminating nor heat damage occuring otherwise.
