Much of the following is being obsoleted by changing out U2 (the AD8244) for something without crossover distortion in its input bias current.  I'll post the changes as parts come in, but for now I'm leaving this out here:

To buy your own PCB you'll send [this file](https://github.com/kenneth558/plant_resistance_primary_perception/blob/Free/Where%20to%20find%20everything%20for%20making%20your%20own%20GWAAMC%20device/Files%20you%20need%20relative%20to%20the%20printed%20circuit%20board/Rev%208%20in%20progress/uno%20shield%20v1.0%20PCB%20gerbers.zip) and [this file](https://github.com/kenneth558/plant_resistance_primary_perception/blob/Free/Where%20to%20find%20everything%20for%20making%20your%20own%20GWAAMC%20device/Files%20you%20need%20relative%20to%20the%20printed%20circuit%20board/Rev%208%20in%20progress/Quantum%20MCP4262-502%2025x%20expansion%20flex%20for%20GWAAM-Sea%20Aid%20gerbers.zip) to OSH Park, BasicPCB, PCBWay, or to wherever you choose, then pay and wait.  A minimum quantity purchase of 3-5 boards is normal.  I actually can't recommend the ENIG boards because industry wisdom is now that the gold on ENIG boards should be washed off ("cleansed") by double tinning.  That negates the entire advantage of ENIG's flat pads for fine pitch components because it takes several hours to double tin and flatten out the pads.  Then on top of that, the last HASL boards I ordered had taken sufficient precautions to give me flat pads on the side of the board it mattered most for me...without me even suggesting it!  That left only one single fine-pich component for me to worry about, and I took care of that easily with Kapton tape/hot air/hot iron pad flattening.  Besides, ENIG boards are limited to a six month shelf life.  So I'm going to recommend just getting lead-free HASL boards, requesting the fab house try to put flattest pads on top (front), and flatten any other fine pitch pads yourself.  On the ENIG boards, a little solder flux helps conduct the heat and makes things less frustrating.  If there is any chance you'll use bismuth solder and you're going the HASL route, specify "lead-free" HASL.  Actually, the best available solder cream is said to be SAC305 (high temperature) rather than anything low temperature (bismuth).  A breakthrough product in July 2019 is No Heat SAC305, but good luck finding any of it right now.

If you are determined to purchase ENIG boards, you can't go wrong with OSH Park because their [rigid] boards handle the heat so well without the copper delaminating nor heat damage occuring otherwise.  Chinese boards will darken and char at much lower heat levels than OSH Park boards, and their copper delaminates from the board at lower heat levels than OSH Park's 2 oz. boards.  OSH Park's flex boards won't handle full-scale air heating without risking bubbles, but if you're carefull to pop those bubbles while they're small, you should be fine.  I've included a spare U9 footprint on the flex board so that the entire board isn't totally ruined by losing only a single footprint to a bubble.

When I got sloppy with the ENIG boards by putting on way more solder than I needed to, I did pull pads up, so you might as well be neat and frugal while tinning, including only tinning one side - the side you need to tin - on the plated through holes.
