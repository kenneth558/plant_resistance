To buy your own PCB you'll send [this file](https://github.com/kenneth558/plant_resistance_primary_perception/blob/Free/Where%20to%20find%20everything%20for%20making%20your%20own%20GWAAMC%20device/Files%20you%20need%20relative%20to%20the%20printed%20circuit%20board/uno%20shield%20v.6%20PCB%20gerbers.zip) to OSH Park or wherever you choose, then pay and wait.  A minimum quantity purchase of 3-5 boards is normal.  I actually can't recommend the OSH Park or anyone else's ENIG boards because industry wisdom is now that the gold on ENIG boards be "washed" off by double tinning.  That negates the entire advantage of ENIG's flat pads with fine pitch components because it takes several hours to double tin and flatten out the pads.  I recommend just getting HASL boards and straight out flatten those pads if you don't get the place-assist holes on fully tinned to work for you. On the ENIG boards, a little solder flux helps conduct the heat and makes things less frustrating.
