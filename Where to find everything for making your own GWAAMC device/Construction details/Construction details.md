 ### DO NOT OPEN PACKAGING FOR U3 (REF200) UNTIL YOU ARE READY TO SOLDER IT IN PLACE AND SOLDER-SEAL SHLD1 IN PLACE AS A SINGLE STEP!  That IC is a high precision component that is designed to give you highest performance when always kept in a very low humidity environment.  (This is also why SHLD1 and all the micro-vias under it should be solder-sealed into hermetically sealed containment.)  If you open that package too soon, here are the instructions to remedy: 
 1. Calculated shelf life in sealed bag: 12 months at <40C and <90% RH from bag seal date.
 2. Peak component body temperature for soldering: 260C(500F)
 3. After bag is opened, devices that will be subjected to reflow solder or other high temperature process must be 
   a) Mounted within 168 hrs of factory conditions of <30C/60% RH, or
   b) Stored per J-STD-033
 4. Devices require bake before mounting if:
   a) Humidity indicator card reads >10%
   b) When 3a or 3b are not met
 5. If baking is required, refer to IPC/JEDEC J-STD-033 for bake procedure.

This project is very difficult to build.  If you think you can do it without use of a microscope or loupes, I'll bet against your success.  If you can find in your heart to get a microscope, you'll be able to put it to good use later to visually magnify growth of the plant at the ends of branches as yet another means of real-time feedback.  If I could have designed the circuit to employ components packaged in more manageable sized packaged, believe me, I would have done so.  Between U1, U2, and U3 there is no getting around using the microscopic packages that the component manufacturers decided upon, so the remainder of the packages might as well follow suit, IMHO.

The hardest aspect of construction might be soldering the SMDs.  It will be easier if you understand about eutectic composition of alloys if soldering to a plated or tinned board, as well as gold embrittlement of solder.  The plating/tinning supplied by the board manufacturer cross contaminates the solder you are adding, making your solder's melting point higher which tends to de-wet the pads.  The only exception would be if the manufacturer tinned the pads with eutectic solder and your solder was of the same elemental metals and also eutectic or slightly non-eutectic.  If your board is plated rather than tinned, or tinned with some alloy dissimilar to your solder, you'll have to brute force it by using 10-20° F hotter soldering temperature than your solder liquidus temperature, with 30°C to 50°C actually being the official industry recommendation.  Yes, this does apply even for precious metal plated. Note that bismuth cross contaminated by lead is to be avoided due to any lead whatsoever will always weaken that solder by forming 95C melting point aspects within the final joint.  Therefore bismuth solder is suitable for use only on boards made to be lead-free.  I haven't noticed bare copper boards to have the problem of cross contamination de-wetting, but you should realize that copper oxidizes so quickly that you will likely need rosin/flux applied along with the solder to de-oxidize pads on a bare copper board.  Also note that total removal of any gold plating is mandated by industry wisdom if using SnPb solder.  (All solder has the Sn component so you might as well accept the understanding that gold and lead must not be mixed in the final solder joint..."wash" the ENIG off by double tinning before soldering with any solder with Pb is the necessary practice.)

I'm hoping the latest addition of place-assist holes around the fine-pitch components will permit use of lead-free HASL instead of ENIG if you're willing to use straight pins to position those components.  These holes are placed surrounding the fine pitch components without any particular right or wrong technique for their use other than, if used, they absolutely must be used non-destructively.  Those that are more distant from the footprint may need spacer materials with the straight pins/carbon fibers.
 
If you try to use solid solder instead of paste solder and under Kapton tape holding things together, it will take longer for the pad to heat up using hot air, so stay on the solder an extra 15-20 seconds after you see it melt.  You may consider adding a dab of solder flux to the solder and component in that scenario just to help heat the pad quicker.  I had success when I only covered half of the component plus the tiny, appropriately sized bits of solder one at each end; the air could reach half the pads and component one side of their center line.  To keep any of the three pieces from blowing away, I dabbed a tiny bit of rosin on them as well.  The size of that most difficult component (spec'd for a 0201 footprint) is even smaller than merely one solder-pad end of a 0603 component, and I used tin/silver (Sn97Ag3) solder, just so you know.  That takes care of the most difficult combination for soldering technique anyone would think to choose, I'm sure.  If you purchase the components from my BOM, you won't see that sized component because when I saw how microscopic it is, I changed the BOM so as to get it in the 0603 package.  However on the PCB layout as of this moment, I have the component footprint doubled 0603 and 0201 so I can use up my 0201 packages from the same PCB design the rest of you will use.
 
For anyone searching sites that give soldering tips, be aware that most boards are single side components while this project provides the design for components on both sides.  So remember that you'll be soldering components to the second side while the first side's components must not fall off from getting their solder re-flowed.  Decide how you'll keep that first side cool while soldering the second side.

OPTIONAL:  Quick and dirty operation can be achieved with just the Arduino and the DUT with balancing resistor connected to +5 VDC...and electrodes  Just set the appropriate pre-processor macros:  disable the USING_LM334... macro, the NUM_OF_OUTBOARDS... macro [and maybe the SUPERIMPOSE_FIRST_INBOARDS... macro if you want two pins plotted magnified (superimposing disables the magnified view of a signal)].  IOW, the AD8244, digipots, and high sensitivity ADC are optional if you just want to see a plotline respond to your finger touching it.  The digipots also won't do anything for you if you use a rail-to-rail ADC, as the ADS1X15 is.  

You might be able to be notified of my changes to the project by GitHub settings, if you use the Github cloning & tracking feature, maybe...cloning is not a GitHub feature I've ever used, yet.

Electrodes are vaporware as of yet: I'm hoping to use dry (not prepreg) carbon fiber tow.  The carbon fiber must establish its electrical connection to the circuit via gold plated contact or else corrosion will ensue.  Alternatives to gold are few and more rare.

NOTE IF 3.3V OPERATION IS DESIRED:  Pin 5 of J2 will have to be omitted and the pad of the adjacent pin 4 J2 will have to be shorted over to the pad of that pin 5.  I neglected to leave room for the jumper to do this.  Sorry!   Only do this when pin 2 of ICSP1 from the MCU is also providing +3.3V!!!!

If for some odd reason you are stuck using the "not recommended due to far lower resolution" ADS1X15, observe the following 3 points:

 ##### 1.  A decoupling capacitor is required at the ADS1X15 device VDD to GND.  From the datasheet:
>Good power-supply decoupling is important to achieve optimum performance. VDD must be decoupled with at least a 0.1-μF capacitor, as shown in Figure 47. The 0.1-μF bypass capacitor supplies the momentary bursts of extra current required from the supply when the device is converting. Place the bypass capacitor as close to the power-supply pin of the device as possible using low-impedance connections. Use multilayer ceramic chip capacitors (MLCCs) that offer low equivalent series resistance (ESR) and inductance (ESL) characteristics for power-supply decoupling purposes. For very sensitive systems, or for systems in harsh noise environments, avoid the use of vias for connecting the capacitors to the device pins for better noise immunity. The use of multiple vias in parallel lowers the overall inductance, and is beneficial for connections to ground planes.

 ##### 2.  An RC filter to each used ADS1X15 analog input is advised by the manufacturer.  From the datasheet:
>...any noise pick-up along the sensor wiring or the application circuitry can potentially alias into the pass-band. Power line-cycle frequency and harmonics are one common noise source. External noise can also be generated from electromagnetic interference (EMI) or radio frequency interference (RFI) sources, such as nearby motors and cellular phones. Another noise source typically exists on the printed-circuit-board (PCB) itself in the form of clocks and other digital signals. Analog input filtering helps remove unwanted signals from affecting the measurement result...

 ##### 3.  Unused analog input pins of the ADS1X15 should not be connected to GND or more power supply current will be drawn than is necessary.  From the datasheet:
>Either float unused analog inputs, or tie the unused analog inputs to midsupply or VDD. Connecting unused analog inputs to GND is possible, but may yield higher leakage currents than the previous options.

Many other application tips are in the datasheet.  I don't mean to discourage you with technical reading, but those tips _are_ useful, and some diagrams are in there that could help hold your attention.  I won't include any links here b/c they so often go dead.  I'll offer one tip I didn't find stated very clear in the datasheet concerning ADS1X15 ground path.  When the ADS device is configured for single-ended as opposed to differential usage, the reference electrode wire should connect to the ADS1X15 approaching it from the opposite direction that it connects to the Arduino GND.  In other words, looking at the ADS1X15, it is a two sided device, front and back, where two two sides are divided from each other by a single row of pins.  If the Arduino GND connects via the back side, then the reference electrode wire should connect via the front side, and vice versa.  This means that the common practice of soldering header pins that exit only from the back side of the ADS1X15 should be critically reconsidered for its GND pin.  A longer than normal pin or wire should be used so it can provide connection both from the front side of the ADS1X15 and from the back, as in the picture below.![How the ground pin needs to extend from both sides of the ADS board](https://github.com/kenneth558/plant_resistance_primary_perception/blob/Free/embeddeds/adc%20primary%20perception%20ADS%20board%20ground%20pin%20cropped.png)You'll note that I had no long pin so I could only push the standard-length pin halfway through the board.  It was only barely long enough on each side, emphasis on "barely".  

The power decoupling capacitor must *not* be connected on the ADS1X15 signal side of that pin/wire, yet as close as possible on the other (power) side.
