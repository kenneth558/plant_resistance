THIS PROJECT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO BUILD.  If you think you can do it without using loupes and possibly a microscope, I'll bet against your success.  The loupes will be needed when you need true color and highest resolution to differentiate between metallic and non-metallic specks, when and if you can provide the lighting and short focal distance they need.  The microscope would be useful when you need an adjustable focal range and can tolerate the lack of vendor honesty about the resolution and operating system compatibility from the manufacturer, and inability to adjust color and lighting settings adequately.  If you can find in your heart to get a microscope, you'll be able to put it to good use later to visually magnify growth of the plant at the ends of branches as yet another means of real-time feedback.  If I could have designed the circuit to employ components packaged in more manageable sized packaged, believe me, I would have done so.  Between U3 and one or the other MCP4262, there is no getting around using the microscopic packages that the component manufacturers calously decided upon, so the remainder of the packages might as well follow suit, IMHO.  In retrospect, I don't think I could have fit the circuit into an UNO-sized board if I would have used larger packages anyway.

I can't envision anyone successfully building this circuit board who doesn't know what a short and open is and who doesn't know why and how to both visual and meter for them and to meter for voltage and resistance.  Please don't embark on building this yourself without at least that level of knowledge unless you are the world's most perfect solderer.

The hardest aspect of construction might be soldering the SMDs.  You might not expect this, but will be easier if you understand about eutectic composition of alloys if soldering to a plated or tinned board, as well as understand about gold embrittlement of solder.  The plating/tinning supplied by the board manufacturer cross contaminates the solder you are adding, making your solder's melting point higher, which tends to de-wet the pads.  Worse yet, atoms of gold and silver tend to produce molecular bonds instead of metallic bonds and extract atoms from their stronger bonded alloy state into "intermetallic" and mechanically weak substances over time.  If your board is plated rather than tinned, or tinned with some alloy dissimilar to your solder, you'll have to brute force it by using 30-50°F hotter soldering temperature than your solder liquidus temperature, with 30-50°C (54-90°F) hotter actually being the official industry recommendation.  Yes, this does apply even for precious metal plated.  Removal of gold plating is mandated by industry wisdom if using SnPb solder, yet no-lead solder is still negatively affected by gold but with a less abrupt failure curve.  "Wash" the ENIG off by double tinning before soldering with any solder with Pb is the necessary practice.  An exception might be for an In-containing solder that actually turns the lead beneficial for use with gold if done right.  

Note that bismuth cross contaminated by lead is to be avoided at all costs due to any lead whatsoever will always weaken that solder by forming 95°C melting point aspects within the final joint.  Therefore bismuth solder is suitable for use only on boards made to be lead-free.  I haven't noticed bare copper boards to have the problem of cross contamination de-wetting, but you should realize that copper oxidizes so quickly that you will likely need rosin/flux applied along with the solder to de-oxidize pads on a bare copper board.  In summary, if you find yourself being frustrated by components not taking solder, my first guess would be that either you mixed solders or didn't double tin surfaces thoroughly.

To keep components pieces from blowing away in hot soldering, I dabbed a tiny bit of rosin on their undersides.

In summary, I recommend bismuth paste solder for components with more than two leads and as long as you realize you need to get it hotter while cleansing new plating.   When I build a board _without_ paste or cream solder, I'll expect two solder attempts.  The first is with 97% tin, 3% silver solid solder (especially on two leaded components) and the second pass is spot soldering with bismuth solder of any kind after microscopic inspection of all joints.  I will diligently avoid having Pb solders in the area whenever I have any hopes to use bismuth solders, ever.  I will avoid tinning the through plating of PTH (Plated Through Holes), but will tin those annular rings with bismuth solder.

NEW! Found this solder type mentioned that may obsolete the above paragraph:
"SAC305 is pretty much the best thing since the invention of the banana, and will reliably bond anything to anything"  source: https://hackaday.com/2017/05/10/designing-for-fab-a-heads-up-before-designing-pcbs-for-professional-assembly/#comments.  Upon further investigation, this solder is high-temp, just so you know.

For anyone searching sites that give soldering tips, be aware that most boards are single side components while this project provides the design for components on both sides.  So remember that you'll be soldering components to the second side while the first side's components must not fall off from getting their solder re-flowed.  Decide how you'll keep that first side cool while soldering the second side.

### DO NOT OPEN U4 (REF200) PACKAGING UNTIL YOU ARE READY TO SOLDER IT IN PLACE AND SOLDER-SEAL SHLD1, SHLD2, and SHLD3 IN PLACE WITH DISSICANT AS A SINGLE STEP!  That IC is a high precision component that is designed to give you highest performance when always kept in a very low humidity environment.  (This is also why the micro-vias under only one shield should be solder-sealed into hermetically sealed containment.)  If you open that package too soon, here are the instructions to remedy: 
 1. Calculated shelf life in sealed bag: 12 months at <40°C and <90% RH from bag seal date.
 2. Peak component body temperature for soldering: 260°C(500°F)
 3. After bag is opened, devices that will be subjected to reflow solder or other high temperature process must be 
   a) Mounted within 168 hrs of factory conditions of <30C/60% RH, or
   b) Stored per J-STD-033
 4. Devices require bake before mounting if:
   a) Humidity indicator card reads >10%
   b) When 3a or 3b are not met
 5. If baking is required, refer to IPC/JEDEC J-STD-033 (Level 3 MSL components, 1.75mm thickness, 260°C peak body temp) for the prescribed bake procedure.

#### The dessicant package you receive with U4 and which you won't be able to see until the moment you need to place it will likely be too large to place inside SHLD1 where it eventually needs be placed.  You will be wise, therefore, to keep your eyes open for a smaller dissicant package that you can repurpose from some other product that will fit inside the SHLD1 lid.  Bake it for most of a day in an electric oven at a temperature near the boiling point of water, then keep it dry (hermetically sealed) until you go to place it.

Electrodes are vaporware as of yet: I'm hoping to use non-impregnated carbon fiber tow, not the prepreg tow.  The carbon fiber must establish its electrical connection to the circuit via gold plated contact or else corrosion will ensue.  Alternatives to gold are fewer and more rare.

Hours of my development time has been wasted because I had no solder wick left.  Do yourself a favor and make sure to have solder wick available.

NOTE IF 3.3V OPERATION IS DESIRED:  Pin 5 of J2 will have to be omitted and the pad of the adjacent pin 4 J2 will have to be shorted over to the pad of that pin 5.  I neglected to leave room for the jumper to do this.  Sorry!   Only do this when pin 2 of ICSP1 from the MCU is also providing +3.3V!!!!
