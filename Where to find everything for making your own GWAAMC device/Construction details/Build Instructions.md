1.  With the jigs, highlight all their debossed references.  One way to do this might be to mark into them with a permanent marker and clean up the overspill.
2.  Soldering to such small pads requires absolute cleanliness to be maintained of all surface mount surfaces to be soldered to.  Let no bodily sweat, oils nor fluids touch the SMD component leads prior to placing nor to the printed circuit board pads prior to soldering. Wearing surgical gloves might be a good idea.  Cleaing those surfaces with isopropyl alcohol immediately prior to soldering might be a good idea, too. 
3.  Components must fit into their cavities loosely enough that they would fall right out if gently flipped over, but tightly enough that they are very accurately placed.  Their solder surfaces should be flush with the top surface around their cavities.
