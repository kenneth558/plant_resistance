The boards have yet another design error with the footprint for the head phone jack going to the plant.  Although I wired around it, I can't expect anyone else to.  The circuit still works, but new main board design is required for everyone but me.  Sorry. - Ken Oct 10, 2019 until I get the new design out there.  Give me until Oct 12 - Thanks!
