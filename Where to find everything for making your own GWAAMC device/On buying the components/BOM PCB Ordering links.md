### PCB Gerber files - you'll need both baords
##### Here is a link to the main board gerber files of my PCB design:

### PCB Comparison sites
##### Printed circuit boards can be ordered from any one of a multitude of fabricators.  Compare between fabricators by visiting one or more of the fabricator comparison sites like https://www.pcbdirectory.com/get-quotations or https://pcbshopper.com or read the fabricator site collection list at https://www.eevblog.com/wiki/index.php?title=PCB_Manufacturers or search "online pcb quote".

The PCB project is also published by OSH Park PCB fabrication here: https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/45GiirVJ.  They would appreciate your business if you're going to buy the gold plated board (ENIG) only.
 
 I would encourage you to order RoHS (environmental friendly) wherever you're given that option, paying a very slight extra to do so.  Especially if you appreciate me making these plans freely available and so plan to send me your excess.
### BOM https://github.com/kenneth558/plant_resistance_primary_perception/blob/Free/Where%20to%20find%20everything%20for%20making%20your%20own%20GWAAMC%20device/On%20buying%20the%20components/ibom.html.  Sorry for the inconvenience about how this file is viewed - it cannot simply be clicked on.  It must be offloaded from GitHub because Github doesn't serve it to your computer as a simple web page.

RELIABILITY NOTE:
OUR MANY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE DATA ACCUMULATION INDICATE
THAT SOLDER HEAT IS A MAJOR CAUSE OF EARLY AND FUTURE
FAILURE.  PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR SOLDERING PROCESS.

Despite the grammar fail, you'll do well to take to heart its meaning, both for components and the printed circuit board.
