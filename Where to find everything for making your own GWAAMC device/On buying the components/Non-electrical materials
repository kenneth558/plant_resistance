· 1 roll Polyimide (Kapton) tape 3/8" wide 6' length or greater.  Use as electrical insulator and place assist. P/N 3057 from Arrow 
or equivalent
· 38ga magnet wire for trace repairs.  P/N 3522 from Arrow or equivalent
· Solder wick P/N TOL-09327 from Arrow or equivalent
· Soldering colophony (pine or gum ROSIN - NOT with zinc nor ammonium chlorides) flux (can make it yourself)
· RG316 Coaxial cable 2m/6.5ft min length
· Multi-conductor flat IDC ribbon cable or hookup wire.  P/N 2001 to 2006 from Arrow
· Electrode clamshells; one per leaf electrode.  Having attachment means and gripping spring somewhere along hinge axis and 
having enough suspending points spread out to hold clamshell in any specific orientation needed.  
· 2 Electrode clamshell cushions made from white or ivory color "Kayser-Roth No nonsense knee high 100% nylon socks MADE 
IN USA" UPC 70011195323 (https://www.upcindex.com/70011195323), partially filled with craft-spec styrofoam balls, aka "beads" 
or "beans", approx. 3mm dia.  Per Kayser Roth Consumer Care: "You are able to order the Nononsense Knee Highs on our online 
website nononsense.com. If you are wanting to order them locally you might be able to find them at a Shop-Rite, Walgreens, 
Rite-Aid, Food Lion, Harris Teeter, HEB, CVS, or local supermarkets around you."  Yet I actually found them at Wal-Mart.
· Electrode suspension device of your own making that won't sink into ground and extends a guy strings hang point above DUT
· Carbon fiber tow, non-impregnated with a gold-plated transition pin per electrode (we have no source yet, but "non-impregnated" 
basically means "not the shiny type").  The transition pin will interface between the carbon fiber and wiring to the receptacle that
receives the coaxial cable plug.  Ensure that conductor material transitions are both (excitation/sense side and return sides of 
the coax cable) identical so the transitions' galvanic voltages cancel out.

NOTE - Very high temp solder (K100) not allowed on U4.  The best solder will always be "No Heat SAC305" if you can find it, but 
you still MUST cleanse gold from pads.  Avoid Pb (leaded) solder unless you understand the behavior of eutectics, how Pb ruins 
other solders, and how gold from ENIG ruins Pb solder.
