Kapton tape WILL be needed.  It doesn't get into the BOM because it is not a circuit component.  If you want to laser cut stencils from it, get 2" wide and 6" long minimum plus what you'll need for place assist holding tape (3/8" wide, 6' long)

1 roll Polyimide tape 3/8" wide 6' length or greater.  Electrical insulator and place assist.  P/N 3057 from Arrow or equivalent
