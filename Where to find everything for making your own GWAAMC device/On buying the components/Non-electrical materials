Kapton tape (Polyimide) WILL be needed.  It doesn't get into the BOM because it is not a circuit component.  If you want to laser cut stencils from it, get 2" wide and 6" long minimum plus what you'll need for place assist holding tape (3/8" wide, 6' long)

1 roll Polyimide tape 3/8" wide 6' length or greater.  Use as electrical insulator and place assist. P/N 3057 from Arrow or equivalent

38ga magnet wire for U8+ and for trace repairs.  P/N 3522 from Arrow or equivalent

The best solder will always be "No Heat SAC305" if you can find it, but you still MUST cleanse gold from pads.
Avoid Pb (leaded) solder unless you understand the behavior of eutectics, how Pb ruins other solders, and how gold from ENIG ruins it.
Solder wick P/N TOL-09327 from Arrow or equivalent
Soldering colophony (pine or gum ROSIN - NOT with zinc or ammonium chloride) flux (can make it yourself)

Multi-conductor flat cable hookup wire

Carbon fiber tow, non-impregnated with a gold-plated connector per electrode (our source is www.cfamills.com, David Shippee, Executive Director of Sales, P.O. Box 609, 105 Pierpoint Lane, Taylorsville, NC  28681, 828.855.5137  Mobile, 828.632.5220  Office )
