Kapton tape (Polyimide) WILL be needed.  It doesn't get into the BOM because it is not a circuit component.  If you want to laser cut stencils from it, get 2" wide and 6" long minimum plus what you'll need for place assist holding tape (3/8" wide, 6' long)

1 roll Polyimide tape 3/8" wide 6' length or greater.  Use as electrical insulator and place assist. P/N 3057 from Arrow or equivalent

38ga magnet wire for U8+ and for trace repairs.  P/N 3522 from Arrow or equivalent

Soldering Colophony (pine or gum rosin) flux (can make yourself to save $) and solder wick P/N TOL-09327 from Arrow or equivalent

Multi-conductor flat cable hookup wire

Carbon fiber tow, non-impregnated with a gold-plated connector per electrode (we have no source, yet)

Avoid Pb (leaded) solder unless you understand the chemistry of eutectics, how it ruins other solders, and how gold from ENIG ruins it.

The best solder will always be "No Heat SAC305" if you can find it, but even then you still MUST cleanse gold from pads if you bought ENIG boards.
