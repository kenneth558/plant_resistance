Kapton tape WILL be needed.  It doesn't get into the BOM because it is not a circuit component.  If you want to laser cut stencils from it, get 2" wide and 6" long minimum plus what you'll need for place assist holding tape (3/8" wide, 6' long)

1 roll Polyimide tape 3/8" wide 6' length or greater.  Electrical insulator and place assist.  P/N 3057 from Arrow or equivalent

Electrodes have to be constructed from non-prepreg carbon fiber tow "yarn" (good luck finding any, you may just have to use prepreg, but don't get "spread" fiber) as the electrode elements, women's nylon stocking, craft-rated styrofoam "beans" that go inside the stockings, lightweight wooden paddles as backing for the nylon stocking bean bags that press against the plant leaves, gold-plated pins to contact the carbon fiber, and some type of hinging mechanism for the paddles if you want, and a 1/8" jack and the wiring and soldering to electrically attach the gold pin into the jack.
